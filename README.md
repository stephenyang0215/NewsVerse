# Purpose: 

The purpose of this application is to create an unbiased news platform where users can access a diverse array of sources, ensuring they receive a well-rounded view of current events. It can be referred to as unbiased as we are deriving the news from different sources. We plan to use AI semantic analysis on the news and filter it on the basis of biased or unbiasedness. By aggregating content from different APIs, the app delivers comprehensive news coverage across various categories such as national headlines, business, sports, international relations, weather, stock markets, technology, and art. With live updates and personalized content, users can stay informed on the topics that matter most to them, fostering deeper engagement with the news in a balanced and inclusive way.
